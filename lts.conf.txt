          This parameter determines weather autogenerated host names are appended with information based on
          the ip address or mac address. Values are "ip" or "mac".

   NBD_SWAP
          boolean, default False
          Set this to True if you want to turn on NBD swap.
          If you enable this, you'll need to add the line:
                        nbdswapd: ALL: keepalive


          to your /etc/hosts.allow file.

   NBD_SWAP_PORT
          integer, default 9572
          The port on which NBD swapping will occur. This is set to 9572 by default.

   NBD_SWAP_SERVER
          IP address, default SERVER
          The NBD swap server can exist on any server on the network that is capable of handling it. You can
          specify the IP address of that server. The default is whatever the value of SERVER set to.

   SERVER
          IP address, default unset
          This is the server that is used for the XDM_SERVER, TELNET_HOST, XFS_SERVER and SYSLOG_HOST, if any
          of those are not specified explicitly. If you have one machine that is acting as the server for
          everything, then you can just specify the address here and omit the other server parameters. If
          this value is not set, it will be auto detected as the machine that the thin client booted from.

   SYSLOG_HOST
          IP address, default unset
          If you want to send logging messages to a machine other than the default server, then you can

   SHUTDOWN_TIME
          string, format hh:mm:ss in 24 hour format, default unset
          Time at which thin client will automatically shut down.

   LTSP_RW_DIRS
          string, default varies by distro
          A list of directories mounted at boot with writeable permissions. The directory tree and
          permissions will be preserved, but no files within any directories will be copied.
          Changing this value will override the defaults. you may append to the list by using the
          LTSP_RW_DIRS_EXTRA variable instead.

   LTSP_COPY_DIRS
          string, default varies by distro
          A list of directories mounted at boot with writeable permissions. The directory tree, files and
          permissions will be preserved.
          Changing this value will override the defaults. you may append to the list by using the
          LTSP_COPY_DIRS_EXTRA variable instead.

   LTSP_BINDFILES
          string, default varies by distro

   NFS_HOME
          string, default unset
          Use NFS for mounting homedirs, instead of sshfs.

   NFS_HOME_OPTIONS
          string, default unset
          Mount options to use with NFS_HOME.



LTS.CONF - LOCAL DEVICES

   LOCALDEV
          boolean, default True
          This parameter enables local devices support, like CD's and USB sticks. Users plugging them in
          should see them on the desktop, after they've been allowed to access the FUSE subsystem on the
          server. Check your distibutions docs to see how this is done on your distribution.

   LOCALDEV_DENY_CD
          boolean, default False
          This parameter disables local device support for CD and DVD-rom devices.

   LOCALDEV_DENY_FLOPPY
          boolean, default False
          This parameter disables local device support for floppy devices.

   LOCALDEV_DENY_INTERNAL_DISKS
          boolean, default True
          This parameter disables local device support for internal ATA and SCSI hard disk devices.

   LOCALDEV_DENY_USB
          boolean, default False
          This parameter disables local device support for USB devices.

   LOCALDEV_DENY
          string, default unset
          This parameter disables local device support for devices matching certain patterns. Values are
          specified as a comma-separated list of sysfs attributes, which can be obtained by using udevadm
          info (or udevinfo). for example:
                        udevadm info -q env -n /dev/hda
                        ID_TYPE=disk
                        ID_BUS=ata


          should return a list of the attributes relevent to /dev/hda. to exclude this disk and disks like it
          using LOCALDEV_DENY: LOCALDEV_DENY="ID_BUS:ata+ID_TYPE:disk" would match devices that were on the
          ata bus that were disks.



LTS.CONF - SCRIPTS AND MODULES

   MODULE_01...MODULE_10
          string, default unset
          Up to 10 kernel modules can be loaded by using these configuration entries. The entire command line
          that you would use when running insmod can be specified here. For example:
MODULE_01 = uart401.o
MODULE_02 = "sb.o io=0x220 irq=5 dma=1"
MODULE_03 = opl3.o


          If the value of this parameter is an absolute path name, then insmod will be used to load the
          module. Otherwise, modprobe will be used.
          In normal circumstances, you shouldn't need to specify anything here, as most hardware will be
          auto-detected.

   RCFILE_01...RCFILE_10
          A custom rc file, default unset
          Additional RC scripts can be executed by the ltsp-client-setup script. Just put the script in the
          /opt/ltsp/i386/etc/init.d directory, and specify the name of the script in one of these entries.
          Note that you must specify a full path, relative to the chroot. So, for example, if you have an RC
          file called /opt/ltsp/i386/etc/init.d/myrcfile, you'd specify:
RCFILE_01=/etc/init.d/myrcfile


          In your lts.conf file.



LTS.CONF - PRINTER PARAMETERS

   PRINTER_0_DEVICE
          string, default unset
          The device name of the printer. Valid device names such as /dev/lp0, or /dev/usblp0 are allowed.

          (except for serial).

   PRINTER_0_WRITE_ONLY
          boolean, default False
          Some parallel printers may need this set in order for the thin client to communicate to them
          properly. If you have problems with a parallel printer only printing part of the print job, try
          setting this to True.

   PRINTER_0_SPEED
          integer, default 9600
          Should be set to the baud rate of the printer (serial printers only).

   LDM_PRINTER_DEFAULT
          string, default unset
          Default printer for the thin client.

   SCANNER
          boolean, default unset
          This parameter enables scanners for the thin client.



LTS.CONF - KEYBOARD PARAMETERS

LTS.CONF TOUCHSCREEN PARAMETERS

   USE_TOUCH
          Enable touchscreen
          default <unset>, Enable touchscreen

          X_TOUCH_DEVICE   Path to device     /dev/ttyS0  set device for touchscreen
          X_TOUCH_DRIVER   Touchscreen driver elographics set driver for touchscreen
          X_TOUCH_MAXX     integer            3588        Xmax

          X_TOUCH_RTPDELAY integer            10          Repeat touch delay



SOUND AND VOLUME CONTROL PARAMETERS

   These parameters allow you to control the volume on the thin client.

   SOUND
          boolean, default True
          This parameter enables sound for the thin client.

   SOUND_DAEMON
          string, default pulse
          This parameter sets which sound daemon to use on the thin client. Values are esd, nasd, and pulse
          (default).

   VOLUME
          integer, default 90
          This represents an integer percentage of the volume, ranging from 0 to 100%.

   HEADPHONE_VOLUME
          integer, default unset
          This represents an integer percentage of the headphone volume, ranging from 0 to 100%.

   PCM_VOLUME
          integer, default unset
          This represents an integer percentage of the PCM volume, ranging from 0 to 100%.

   CD_VOLUME
          integer, default unset
          This represents an integer percentage of the CD input volume, ranging from 0 to 100%.

   FRONT_VOLUME
          integer, default unset
          This represents an integer percentage of the front speaker volume, ranging from 0 to 100%.

   MIC_VOLUME
          integer, default unset
          This represents an integer percentage of the microphone input volume, ranging from 0 to 100%.



LTS.CONF - XORG PARAMETERS

   These parameters affect how Xorg behaves.

   USE_XFS
          boolean, default False
          Instructs the thin client to look at the XFS_SERVER option, and use XFS for serving fonts.

   XFS_SERVER
          IP address, default unset
          If you are using an X Font Server to serve fonts, then you can use this entry to specify the IP
          address of the host that is acting as the font server. If this is not specified, it will use the
          default server, which is specified with the SERVER entry described above.

   CONFIGURE_X
          If you want to be able to configure the individual settings of the X configuration file, without
          having the X automatically configure the graphics card for you, you must enable this option. By
          default this option is turned off. To turn it on do:
CONFIGURE_X = True

          . You don't need this option just for keyboard and mouse settings. It corresponds to the graphic
          card and monitor options only.

   X_CONF
          string, default unset
          If you want to create your own complete X.org config file, you can do so and place it in the
          /opt/ltsp/<arch>/etc/X11 directory. Then, whatever you decide to call it needs to be entered as a
          value for this configuration variable. For example: X_CONF = /etc/X11/my-custom-xorg.conf Note that
          for the thin client, you reference it from /etc/X11.

   X_RAMPERC
          default '100', Percentage of RAM for X server
          Some programs allocate a large amount of ram in the X.org server running on your thin client.
          Programs like Firefox and Evince can use up so much ram, that they eventually exhaust all your
          physical ram, and NBD swap, causing your thin client to crash. If you find your clients being
          booted back to a login prompt, or freezing up when viewing certain PDF's or web pages, this may be
          the problem.
          The X_RAMPERC variable stands for X RAM PERCent, and is a number between 0 and 100 that specifies
          how much of the free space on your thin client X.org is allowed to consume. You'll generally want
          to set it at something lower than 100 percent, if you're having problems. Experimentation has shown
          a value between 80 and 90 will usually keep the terminal alive. What will then happen is the
          program consuming the memory will die, as opposed to the thin client itself. If you're having
          unexplained terminal problems, specifying:
          X_RAMPERC = 80
          in your lts.conf file may improve things.

   X_VIRTUAL
          string, default unset
          If you want to have a virtual screen which is larger than the physical screen on your thin client,
          you would configure that by providing a string of the form "width height" in this parameter,
          similar to the xorg.conf format.

   XDM_SERVER
          IP address, default unset
          If you're using the older startx screen script, and need to specify a different XDMCP server, then
          you can specify the server here. If this parameter is NOT specified, then it will use the SERVER
          parameter described above.

   XSERVER
          You can use this parameter to override which X server the thin client will run. For PCI and AGP
          video cards, this parameter should not be required. The thin client should normally be able to
          auto-detect the card.
          If, for some reason you do need to manually set it, here are some valid values:
          ark, ati, atimisc, chips, cirrus_alpine cirrus, cirrus_laguna, cyrix, dummy, fbdev fglrx, glint,
          i128, i740, i810, imstt, mga, neomagic, newport, nsc, nv, r128, radeon, rendition, riva128, s3,
          s3virge, savage, siliconmotion, sis, sisusb, tdfx, tga, trident, tseng, v4l, vesa, vga, via,
          vmware, voodoo

   X_MOUSE_DEVICE
          string, default unset
          This is the device node that the mouse is connected to. If it is a serial mouse, this would be a
          serial port, such as /dev/ttyS0 or /dev/ttyS1. This is not needed for PS/2 or USB mice, as they are
          auto-detected.

   X_MOUSE_PROTOCOL
          Should be auto-detected. However, valid entries include:
          sunkbd, lkkbd, vsxxxaa, spaceorb, spaceball, magellan, warrior, stinger, mousesystems, sunmouse,
          microsoft, mshack, mouseman, intellimouse, mmwheel, iforce, h3600ts, stowawaykbd, ps2serkbd,
          twiddler, twiddlerjoy

   X_MOUSE_EMULATE3BTN
          boolean, default unset
          Normally unset, may need to be set to Y for certain 2 button mice.

   X_NUMLOCK
          boolean, default False
          If this variable is set to True, then the numlock key will be defaulted to on when the terminal
          boots. Note that the numlockx command must be installed in the chroot for this to work.

   X_COLOR_DEPTH
          Integer: 2, 4, 8, 16, 24, 32 default 24
          This is the number of bits to use for the colour depth. Possible values are 8, 16, 24 and 32. 8
          bits will give 256 colours, 16 will give 65536 colours, 24 will give 16 million colours and 32 bits
          will give 4.2 billion colours! Not all X servers support all of these values. The default value for
          this is 24.

   X_HORZSYNC
          min-max values
          This sets the X.org HorizSync configuration parameter. This should be auto-detected for your
          monitor, however, if you want to force a lower resolution, use this parameter to do so.

   X_VERTREFRESH
          min-max values
          This sets the X.org VertRefresh configuration parameter. This should be auto-detected for your
          monitor. If you need to force a lower resolution, use this parameter to do so.

   X_VIDEO_RAM
          string, default unset
          This sets the X.org VideoRam configuration parameter. The setting is in kilobytes. This should be
          auto-detected for your monitor. If you need to force a different video ram setting, use this
          parameter to do so.

   X_OPTION_01...X_OPTION_12
          A valid Device option
          This allows you to specify Option settings in the xorg.conf file, to add options to the video
          driver. A common use for this will be to test turning off acceleration in your driver, if you're
          having trouble. An example usage would be:
X_OPTION_01 = "\"NoAccel\"" X_OPTION_02 = "\"AnotherOption\" \"True\""


          You probably won't need these except in special circumstances.

   X_MONITOR_OPTION_01...X_MONITOR_OPTION_10
          string, default unset
          A valid Monitor option, that would normally be used in an xorg.conf file.

   X_MODE_0, X_MODE_1, and X_MODE_2
          string, default unset
          These set the X.org ModeLine configuration. For example, if your thin client comes up in a higher
          resolution than what you want, say, 1280x1024, specifying:
X_MODE_0 = 1024x768


          should get your desired resolution on startup.
          X_MODE_* require XRANDR_DISABLE=True to work. For drivers that support XRANDR, the XRANDR_MODE_*
          variabled are preferred. See the XRANDR section.

   X_BLANKING
          A positive integer
          When set, X_BLANKING will cause DPMS standby to activate after the number of seconds provided. If
          the monitor does not support DPMS, then the blanking screensaver will activate. If X_BLANKING is
          set to 0, the monitor will remain on indefinitely. NOTE: This does not apply to the xdmcp or startx
          screen script. Also, server-side Xclients such as power managers and screensavers may override this
          setting.



LTS.CONF OPTIONS - XRANDR OPTIONS

   XRANDR_ORIENTATION_0 ... XRANDR_ORIENTATION_8
          string, default unset
          Sets the orientation for the corresponding output (for xrandr <1.2).



LTS.CONF OPTIONS - SCREEN SCRIPTS

   SCREEN_01...SCREEN_12
          string, default ldm
          Up to 12 screen scripts can be specified for a thin client. This will give you up to 12 sessions on
          the thin client, each accessible by pressing the Ctrl-Alt-F1 through Ctrl-Alt-F12 keys.
          Currently, possible values include: kiosk, ldm, menu, rdesktop (deprecated), shell, ssh, startx
          (deprecated), telnet, xdmcp, xfreerdp, xterm
          Look in the $CHROOT/usr/share/ltsp/screen.d directory for more scripts, or write your own, and put
          them there.

   TELNET_HOST
          IP address, default unset
          If the thin client is setup to have a character based interface, then the value of this parameter
          will be used as the host to telnet into. If this value is NOT set, then it will use the value of
          SERVER above.



LTS.CONF OPTIONS - LDM OPTIONS

   LDM_AUTOLOGIN
          boolean, default False
          This option allows the thin client to login automatically without the need for a username and
          password. To set it set
LDM_AUTOLOGIN = True

          for the corresponding thin client. This will attempt to log in the thin client with username =
          hostname and password = hostname. You can also set a user and password with LDM_USERNAME and
          LDM_PASSWORD variables.

   LDM_DEBUG
          boolean, default unset
          Turns on ldm debugging on the thin client. Log is written to /var/log/ldm.log on the thin client
          itself.

   LDM_DIRECTX
          boolean, default False
          This is arguably the most important LDM option, as it allows you to turn off the encrypted X tunnel
          via SSH, and instead run a less secure, but much faster unencrypted tunnel. Users who have slower
          thin clients will want to set this to True. It is set to True by default in Fedora.

   LDM_GUESTLOGIN
          boolean, default False
          This option places a GUEST LOGIN button underneath the entry field for username and password. To
          set it set
LDM_GUESTLOGIN = True

          for the corresponding thin client. You can also set a user and password with
LDM_USERNAME = John

          and
LDM_PASSWORD = secret

          , although not setting these will default to the hostname of the thin client.

   LDM_GUEST_SERVER
          string, default unset
          This is a space-separated list of available servers where guest logins are available. The first
          server in the list will be the default guest login server unless the user selects another from the
          preferences menu at login time.

   LDM_ALLOW_USER
          string
          This option allows you to give access to certain thin clients based on the username set in
          /etc/passwd. For example, thin client A should only be used by Jane, Bob, and Fred, while thin
          client B is to be used by Harry only. By adding these options to the corresponding mac addresses
          you allow or deny access to the thin clients in question. Example:
[thin:client:A:mac:address]
LDM_ALLOW_USER = Jane,Bob,Fred
[thin:client:B:mac:adddress]
LDM_ALLOW_USER = Harry


   LDM_LOGIN_TIMEOUT
          integer
          This lets LDM automatically login after the set amount of time in seconds. If you specify this
          option, then do not specify LDM_AUTOLOGIN. Use it in this format:
[thin:client:mac:address]
LDM_LOGIN_TIMEOUT = 25


          Note that you will need to also set LDM_GUESTLOGIN=True for LDM_LOGIN_TIMEOUT to be useful.

   LDM_USERNAME
          string, default unset
          This is the username that LDM will use for autologin.

   LDM_PASSWORD
          string, default unset
          This is the password that LDM will use for autologin.

   LDM_SYSLOG
          boolean, default False
          Normally, LDM logs to a simple file on the thin client, namely /var/log/ldm.log. This has the
          advantage of being fast, but the disadvantage of being hard to read for the administrator in the
          event of a problem, as the administrator must either spawn a shell screen session, or enable root
          login in tty1. By setting this option to "True", you can log up to the server if you've enabled
          your server's syslog for remote logging.

   LDM_SERVER
          string, default unset
          This is a space-separated list of available servers for LDM to log into. The first server in the
          list will be the default server unless the user selects another from the preferences menu at login
          time.

   LDM_LANGUAGE
          string, default unset
          This allows the system administrator to override the default locale settings on the server by
          setting the environment variables LANG, LANGUAGE and LC_ALL at login.
          Use the LANG variable to set the default locale for LDM's user interface.

   LDM_SSHOPTIONS
          string
          Allows you to specify custom options to the ssh sessions started between LDM and the server.

   NETWORK_COMPRESSION
          boolean, default False
          Enables compression of the SSH traffic over the network. Note that while this will reduce your
          network traffic, it will increase your cpu load.

   SSH_OVERRIDE_PORT
          integer, default unset
          If you run your ssh server different from the defult, you may set the port the thin client will use
          with this parameter.

   SSH_FOLLOW_SYMLINKS
          boolean, default True
          Causes sshfs mounted filesystems for local applications to follow symlinks. Should not need to be
          modified under normal circumstances.

   LDM_SESSION
          string, default unset
          Used to chose the default session on the server.

   LDM_XSESSION
          string, default Xsession
          Allows you to specify custom script on the server for LDM to run, rather than the server's standard
          script for starting an X session (usually Xsession).

   LDM_LIMIT_ONE_SESSION
          boolean, default False
          Only allow a given user to log into one thin-client at a time.

   LDM_LIMIT_ONE_SESSION_PROMPT
          boolean, default False
          Prompt to kill processes of other logins when other logins are detected. Requires
          LDM_LIMIT_ONE_SESSION to be set.

   LDM_THEME
          string, default unset
          Specify the name of the LDM theme. It can reference a directory in /usr/share/ldm/themes, or be
          specified as a full path to the theme dir (both relative to the chroot).
          To use the theme in /opt/ltsp/i386/usr/share/ldm/themes/MYTHEME, you'd specify:
LDM_THEME=MYTHEME


          In your lts.conf file.
          Alternately, To use the theme in /opt/ltsp/i386/etc/MYTHEME, you'd specify:
LDM_THEME=/etc/MYTHEME


          In your lts.conf file.



LOCAL APPLICATIONS

   LOCAL_APPS
          boolean, default True
          Enables support for running local apps on the thin client.

   LOCAL_APPS_EXTRAMOUNTS
          string, default unset
          This parameter enables extra mount points to be mounted on the thin client with sshfs. This require
          a commas separated list of directory.

   LOCAL_APPS_MENU
          boolean, default False
          Enables overriding of menu items from remote (server) applications. If this is set to True, local
          applications in the users menu will be used instead of the applications on the server.

   LOCAL_APPS_MENU_ITEMS
          string, default unset
          This item should contain a comma separated list of application names as they appear on their
          .desktop files.

   LOCAL_APPS_WHITELIST
          string, default unset
          Used to allow only specified space-separated commands to be run as local apps, allow all is default
          if unset. Full-paths are required for each command. No spaces in the names are allowed.
